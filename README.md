# Test IOS Dev

This is a sample iOS application demonstrating WiFi and Bluetooth scanning functionalities.

## Features

- **WiFi Scanning:**
  - View current WiFi network information (SSID, BSSID).
  - Scan for and list available WiFi networks.
  - Monitor network status and location permissions.

- **Bluetooth Scanning:**
  - Scan for nearby Bluetooth peripherals.
  - Display discovered devices with details like name, signal strength (RSSI), and device type.
  - View the current Bluetooth state (Powered On, Off, etc.).

## Architecture

The project follows the principles of **Clean Architecture**, separating concerns into three main layers:

- **Presentation:** Contains the UI (SwiftUI views) and ViewModels. It's responsible for displaying data and handling user interactions.
- **Domain:** The core of the application. It contains the business logic, use cases, and entities. This layer is independent of the other layers.
- **Data:** Responsible for data retrieval and storage. It contains repositories and data sources (e.g., for network calls or device hardware access).

This layered architecture makes the codebase modular, scalable, and easier to test.

## Getting Started

This project uses [Tuist](https://tuist.io) for project generation and dependency management.

### Prerequisites

- Xcode
- [Tuist](https://tuist.io)

### Running the App

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open a terminal in the project's root directory.
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    tuist install
    ```
4.  Generate the Xcode project:
    ```bash
    tuist generate
    ```
5.  Open the generated `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode:
    ```bash
    open "Test IOS Dev.xcworkspace"
    ```
6.  Build and run the app on a simulator or a physical device.
